Normalization
--SYNTAX
Determinant --> (Functional) Dependency  
OR
TABLE(Primary, non-key, non-key)

--1ST NORMAL FORM
D – Data Type Consistency (fifty vs 50)
R - No Repeating Groups (No data pertaining to one row split across multiple)
O – Rule of One Instance (One value per cell)
P - Primary Key Established

--2nd NORMAL FORM - Partial Dependency Issue – Non-key can be determined by only ONE part of composite key

AB --> NOP
B --> P
FIX
AB --> NO
B --> P

--3rd NORMAL FORM - Transitive Dependency Issue – Non-key being determined by another non-key.
A --> BNOP
B --> P
FIX
A --> BNO
B --> P


--3.5 (BOYCE-CODD) NORMAL FORM – Like 3rd NF, but a non-key determining a key.
AB --> NOP
N --> B
FIX
AN --> OP
N --> B

--4th NORMAL FORM – Multivalued Dependency Issue – Multiple values of same type (multiple phone numbers, majors) in multiple columns of same row.

AB --> NOP1P2P3
FIX
AB --> NO
AP


--FORMULA FOR FIXING
1. Find the issue
2. Make a new table out of the issue
3. Remove unnecessary parts from original table
4. Establish relationship between the tables
